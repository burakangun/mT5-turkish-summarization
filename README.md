# turkish-summarization
## Project Status

This project is currently under development and is not yet complete. I have finished translating the dataset from English to Turkish. Future work will focus on implementing the summarization algorithm and enhancing the overall functionality.

### Completed Tasks
- Translated dataset from English to Turkish

### Planned Tasks
- Implement Turkish text summarization algorithms
- Optimize model performance
- Add additional features and improvements

Update: Model Ready for Fine-Tuning
With this update, I have prepared the MT5-based Turkish summarization model for fine-tuning. The model is now ready to be customized and trained on specific datasets to enhance its performance. This project is designed for text summarization tasks, aiming to effectively summarize content in the Turkish language.

Next Steps
After completing the fine-tuning process, additional evaluations will be conducted to assess the model's performance and share the results.

Feel free to contribute or check back for updates!
